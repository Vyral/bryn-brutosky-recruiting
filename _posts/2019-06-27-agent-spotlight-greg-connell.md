Greg Connell is a Realtor with Keller Williams Drive. He started in real estate in just Oct 2018, but his tremendous heart for both people and learning has led him to earn 100% commission in his first year with our team. He's leaned into the systems and coaching that we offer and we're tremendously excited to see what this young agent has ahead of him. We're really glad he decided to join us, too. **According to him, it was his first choice and the only brokerage he has worked with.**

*"There's a lot of motivated people here, but the culture is wide open,"* Connell said. *"There's enough work and enough business for everyone. It's a super great environment that continues to grow, flourish, and bring in more and more talent."*
