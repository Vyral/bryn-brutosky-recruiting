What are the Six Personal Perspectives and how can they help you in your business?

**1\. Commit to self-mastery.** This involves self-reflection and educating yourself to be the best you can be within a specific skill set. As you work through each of these perspectives, you'll learn that this isn't about one particular skill set; it's more of an overarching process you continually evolve through. The best part about it is as you work through the process, you start over with new skill sets and new parts to your business. The first step, though, is to recognize where you want to go and commit to self-mastery of whatever it is you're doing, whether that's a skill set, a mindset, a business concept, etc.&nbsp;

**2\. Commit to the 80/20 principle.** Many of us are already familiar with the Pareto Principle, which states that 80% of your results come from 20% of your activities. Committing to the 80/20 principle means committing 80% of your time to that same 20% of activities that produce most of your results.&nbsp;

**3\. Move from E to P.** In this case, the E is entrepreneurship, while the P stands for principles. Entrepreneurship is about creativity, and principles represent proven concepts, systems, and models. The former has tremendous value, but only after you've applied the latter, so start with principles before you embark on entrepreneurship. The vast majority of agents and businesses start with entrepreneurship before applying principles, and this often leads to failure.&nbsp;

**4\. Make being learning-based the foundation of what you do.** This applies to all aspects of your life. If you're not continually seeking new knowledge to help you improve, you'll either stagnate or digress. Being learning-based is the difference between continuous improvement and stagnation or digression.&nbsp;

**5\. Remove your limiting beliefs.** A mindset centered around working for something bigger than yourself is powerful, but one of the biggest things holding us back from doing this is fear of failure. You must be able to overcome this. As you work through these perspectives, your limiting beliefs will diminish automatically.&nbsp;

6\. Be accountable. When individuals surround themselves with great minds and great information, the results are amazing. By doing this, you can accelerate your skills-based learning and your business knowledge. When you have people willing to hold you accountable to the goals you set, your growth is explosive.

Systematically working your way through these perspectives will move you toward the path of success. What success looks like can vary from person to person, but ultimately this boils down to making progress and moving forward.
